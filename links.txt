Construct the authorization header
If you need, you can construct and send the basic authorization header yourself as follows:

Build a string of the form username:password.
Encode the string to Base64.
Supply an authorization header with format Authorization: Basic {encoded-string}. Make sure to replace {encoded-string} with your encoded string from Step 2.
For example, if your username and password are both fred then the string "fred:fred" encodes to ZnJlZDpmcmVk in Base64. You can then make a request with cURL specifying the authorization header with -H as follows:

Copy
curl -H "Authorization: Basic ZnJlZDpmcmVk" -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/rest
